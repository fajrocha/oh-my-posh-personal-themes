# oh-my-posh-personal-themes

Personal themes for [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), to customize the CLI to include extra information. This allows me to quickly access them from any of my machines. Of course, if anyone wants to use them, feel free as well.

The themes here are based on existing ones, with some tweaks, so the nomenclature follows the rule: &lt;original-name&gt;-custom.omp.json.
